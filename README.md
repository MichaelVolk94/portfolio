# Michael Volk's MTM6201 portfolio

# Project Description 
Welcome to my web portfolio, I have created this portfolio as part of the Web Development II course in which I learned about advance CSS and Bootstrap. I built this portfolio based on my design on my UX I course where I had to make a business related to a bakery and I had to make examples of Low and High Fidelity wireframes. And what I did was that I expanded on that idea and turned it into an actual website. 

# Challenges
Making the design and breaking it down to smaller chunks was challenging for me. Especially when I had to do it in such a short timeframe. It also wasn't easy I had other assignments in the way. I also had trouble trying to figure out how to use Schema information, because I never figured out how to use it correctly. 

# Lessons Learned
I learned how to create functional buttons and created individual pages for them without problem. I also learned to be more comfortable with the material I'm given and be more efficient with my time.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
